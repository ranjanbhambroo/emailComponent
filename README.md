# Getting Started with Email Component App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## List of Changes

 Break the Auto suggest dropdown into its own component.

 Write more robust tests to test the app properly.
 
 Use SASS for styling.
 
 Use Typescript instead of javascript.

## Suggestions
 In the design if the email is not in the correct format it shows the `i` icon but i have used to `x` to show it can be deleted which is not there in the design.
